            <h1>What do we know about the ocean?</h1>
            <p>The ocean, a vast and complex saltwater body, covers approximately 71% of Earth's surface and holds about 97% of its water. It's a crucial part of Earth's climate system, regulating temperatures and influencing weather patterns. The ocean is also a major source of oxygen and a home to a diverse range of marine life, according to the National Geographic Society.</p>

            <h1>How does the ocean help us?</h1>
            <p>It provides essential resources like food, oxygen, and fresh water, regulates climate, and supports economic activities.</p>
            <h1>How can we help the ocean?</h1>
            <p>We can reduce our carbon footprint, minimize plastic use, choose sustainable seafood, and conserve water.</p>

            <h1>How are humans hurting the ocean?</h1>
            <p>Humans impact the ocean through various activities, including pollution, overfishing, climate change, habitat destruction, and introducing invasive species. These actions disrupt marine ecosystems, harm marine life, and threaten the ocean's health and biodiversity.</p>
