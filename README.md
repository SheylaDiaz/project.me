Idea #1
The ocean has always been a mystery to me.
 What incredible creatures live in its depths? How does something so vast help balance our climate?

For my capstone project, I want to dive into the hidden wonders of the sea, uncovering fascinating facts, exploring unique species, and sharing the little-known details that make the ocean one of Earth’s greatest marvels.

I'm planning to use three main APIs:
OBIS to gather detailed information about marine life and species data,
Unsplash to source high-quality ocean animal images, and
LibreTranslate to offer multilingual support by translating content into different languages.
Together, these APIs will help bring ocean facts, visuals, and accessibility together in one immersive experience.\

Idea #2 and final project.

On information


I wanted to focus my project on the issue of overfishing because I believe it’s one of the environmental challenges we face today. Many marine species are unable to protect themselves from the impact of human activity, and without action, we risk damage to our oceans and the ecosystems that depend we all depend on. 

I came acros this documentarie  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v5J7aP2FYH4&ab_channel=NationalGeographic" target="_blank">David Attenborough: Ocean</a>  looking for information about my original idea but after watching it it gave me this idea and i loved the messege and i felt like it need to be shared.
